# StringCursor

This is a small yet effective Java backend implementation of cursor-driven string builder
tool.

It aims to provide the tools to manipulate a text block as in a text field, but from the
code itself, allowing for easy custom implementations of text fields.

See inner [implementations](src/main/java/io/github/nerjalnosk/stringcursor) and
[tests](src/test/java/io/github/nerjalnosk/stringcursor) for use-case examples.
